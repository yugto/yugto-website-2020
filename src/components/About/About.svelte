		When I first started Yugto last September 2020, it was only a bookclub for myself. To push myself to read again in Tagalog, to teach myself once more the tales I had ignored, about the stories I had denied, and about the history, I was forgetting... Yet I did not know I was also looking for a community, I did not know I was yearning for my individuality or to find a “creative revenge” from what I was experiencing living abroad or to find what I am here for.

		What I then knew was, I am longing for warm weather, for an endless chat with my friends and family in Tagalog and for a deep connection and conversations.

		7 months passed by, this community not only led me to people with whom I can read a book or to people where I can relate an ‘accent’ with. But a samahan or community that challenges me as to why Yugto even exists and how I would like Yugto to become.

		I am very delighted and grateful. FINALLY I FOUND MY TRIBE, and to share this journey with them is my greatest achievement.

		This is for all of us who are open to relearn, to heal and to love again the story written by our ‘kababayan.’ This is for the next generation Filipinx who would love to get to know more about our own roots and history. And this is for the Filipinx diaspora (like me) who misses our ‘tahanan araw-araw.’
